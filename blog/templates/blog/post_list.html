        <h2><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com">About Django</a></h2>
        <p>
            Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid
            development and clean, pragmatic design. <br />
            Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of
            web development, so you can focus on <br />
            writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and
            open source.
        </p>

        <b>Reasons to use Django</b>
        <p>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    Ridiculously fast.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    Reassuringly secure.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    Exceedingly scalable.
                </ul>
            </li>
        </p>

        <b>What does Django code look like?</b>
        <p>
            In a traditional data-driven website, a web application waits for HTTP
            requests from the web browser (or other client). <br />
            When a request is received the application works out what is needed
            based on the URL and possibly information in POST <br />
            data or GET data. Depending on what is required it may then read or
            write information from a database or perform other <br />
            tasks required to satisfy the request. The application will then return
            a response to the web browser, often dynamically <br />
            creating an HTML page for the browser to display by inserting the
            retrieved data into placeholders in an HTML template.

        </p>

        <br>
        <b>Django web applications typically group the code that handles each of these steps into separate files:</b>
        <p>
            <li>
                <ul><u>URLs:</u> While it is possible to process requests from every single URL via a single function,
                    it is much
                    more maintainable <br>
                    to write a separate view function to handle each resource. A URL mapper is used to redirect
                    HTTP requests to the appropriate <br>
                    view based on the request URL. The URL mapper can also match particular
                    patterns of strings or digits that appear in a URL <br>
                    and pass these to a view function as data.</ul>

                <ul><u>View:</u> A view is a request handler function, which receives HTTP requests and returns HTTP
                    responses.
                    Views
                    access the data <br>
                    needed to satisfy requests via models, and delegate the formatting of the response to
                    templates. </ul>

                <ul><u>Models:</u> Models are Python objects that define the structure of an application's data, and
                    provide
                    mechanisms
                    to manage <br> (add, modify, delete) and query records in the database.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <u>Templates:</u>
                    A template is a text file defining the structure or layout of a file (such as an HTML page),
                    with
                    placeholders used to <br> represent actual content. A view can dynamically create an HTML page using
                    an HTML
                    template, populating it with data from <br> a model. A template can be used to define the structure
                    of any
                    type
                    of file; it doesn't have to be HTML!

                </ul>
            </li>
